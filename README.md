# The-Big-Username-Blacklist
This is a opinionated blacklist of words that you might not like to see used as usernames in your service (think **username**.domain.com, domain.com/**username** or **username**@domain.com).

The editable blacklist can be found in [list_raw.txt](list_raw.txt) and is categorized into six sections:

- **Privileges** User privilege terms to prevent faked authority. Example: _root_, _super_
- **Code**: Programming terms that you might want to avoid in a url. Example: _void_, _null_
- **Terms**: Various technical terms. Example: _request_, _system_
- **Financial**: This is for the spammers/scammers. Example: _payment_, _invoice_
- **Sections**: Common website pages and sections. Example: _faq_, _help_
- **Actions**: User actions. Example: _delete_, _create_

You can try the blacklist using the tool [Username checker](http://marteinn.github.io/The-Big-Username-Blacklist-JS/).

Please note that this list does not contain any curse words, there are [other lists](https://github.com/shutterstock/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words) for that.
